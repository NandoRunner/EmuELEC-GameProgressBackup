# EmuELEC-GameProgressBackup
This tool was created by the desire for me not to lose saved states of games I played.

So the main purpose is to backup game progress files such as .srm and .state[n] to a local folder, in order to do not lose all gamming hours if EmuELEC system, storage or TvBox is lost.
